WORKFLOW
start with analyzing the data you have received
sketch and write a summary of everything you need to do
start with the template provided
set up surge so you can all deploy
create a basic layout together then split the work
make a simple time plan with several checkpoints and compare it to reality
adjust the plan accordingly, the site must be presentable to the client in time (not everything needs to 100% especially if it's not visual)
test the basic layout in all browsers
make it in pure Bootstrap first (won't look exactly the same)
then use BS utilities + customize it to look as designed
try to use BS variables over overriding CSS
use a prefix for all classes you create (namespacing)
test in all browsers after you're done
